# Storybook-Animation
I decided to write a story about what I imagine it is like growing up in the ocean. It's a simple story about a fish and sea turtle that become friends with a whale that protected them from being eaten by a shark. The program was written in a simple form of java, on an application called processing. This application was used mainly to do animations and video games.
